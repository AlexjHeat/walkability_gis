# walkability_gis
 
This program asks for the input of the following datasets for any given city:
* Bikeways
* Bus Stops
* Rail Stations
* Land-Use Plans

Using ArcPy, it then generates a 'suitability score' map showcasing the hot areas in proximity to bikelanes, transit, grocery stores, mixed-use zoning, and other factors.
